# Unemployment-in-Nigeria

A Survival Analysis Approach - Using Non-Parametric, Semi-Parametric, and Parametric approaches to Survival Analysis.

In this study, I exhibited my mastery of the R-Programming language. The time-to-employment of young Nigerian university graduates was modelled using standard survival analysis techniques.

The time-to-employment of young university graduates was modeled using standard survival analysis techniques. Information on Employment Status (currently employed, unemployed) and other socio-demographic factors were obtained on 500 randomly selected graduates from various universities in Nigeria through a well-structured questionnaire. For convenience, graduates from different universities in Nigeria that were currently taking postgraduate programs at the University of Ilorin were considered as the target population on whom the questionnaires were administered.

The study applied survival analysis to employment-related data obtained from a follow-up study of these graduates in order to examine the contributing factors to the unemployment spells of graduates observed in the country at large. Generally, survival analysis is a collection of statistical procedures for the analysis of data in which the outcome variable of interest is the time until an event occurs. By event, we mean death, disease incidence, relapse from remission, or any designated experience of interest that may happen to an individual. However, in this study, the event of interest is time until a Nigerian graduate becomes employed.

This project gives a statistical interpretation of the parameter estimates in terms of Hazard rates. The findings show that the survival analysis used in this research is a powerful tool in providing meaningful interpretations that can be used in future employment analysis and to profer solutions to unemployment in Nigeria.
